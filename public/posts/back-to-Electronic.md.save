# let's learn Eletronics!

I have a degree as an electronics technician. I studied electronics when I was in high school. But in two of three years of studying, the pandemic occurred and lately I feel I not learn almost nothing.

this is unfortunate, because electronics are amazing!

I know basic electrical and how to build a circuit, but i don't know how to create circuits using my knowledge tho. Then, this is my goal: create my own circuits.

First, I will go back to the beginning.

##  What is electricity?

Electricity is a phenomenon associated with stationary or moving electric charges. Eletric charge is a fundamental property of matter and is borne by elementary particles. In electricity, the particle involved is the electron, which carries a charge designated, by convention, as negative. Thus, the various manifestations of electricity are the result of the accumulation or motion of numbers of electrons. Source: Britannica

Electricity always moves from a high potential to a low potential. This potencial relationship means something like "hey I have more electrons than you, then I will give a few to you and let's balance"

Voltage is the potencial diference. Current is the passage of electrons  and resistance is the oposition to the passage of current.

## What is a circuit?

in Electronics, a circuit is a complete circular path that electricity flows through. A simple circuit cosistis of current source, conductors and load.
