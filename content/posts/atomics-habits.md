Reading Atomic Habits, James Clear’s best seller, I learn several lessons to build good habits and break bad ones. The most important thing about habits is your habits system. A good system allows you to improve 1% every day and makes you 37x better a year. If you want results, achieve your goals, you need to focus on your habits system.

# How to change my behavior?

There are three levels that changes could happen:

1. results: here you worry about you goal definition 
2. process: the habits that you intend to create, the system that you are using 
3. identity: you thoughts, you beliefs, self image and judgements 
   

People tend to change their habits aiming for their results, then create goals for that, following this order: 1, 2, 3

“I want to lose weight (result), so I will do this (process) and be healthy (identity).according to James Clear, this is a bad way to start, He calls it “habits for result”. The best way to change you behavior is for habits for identity (i don’t read the english version so i don’t know if this is the nomenclature that he used, i’m just translating Portuguese to english using my knowledge, sorry for this). 

Habits for identity are your habits that you do for your identity. Think of two smokers. one of them, when asked if he wanted a cigarette, he answered “no, i’m just trying to stop”. It seems that he still is a smoker, right? Now, the other, when asked the same question, said “i don’t smoke, i’m not a smoker”. Do you see the difference? The second smoker changed his identity. When you have an identity, you will do actions that reinforce your identity. You should first change your identity(3), to focus on the process(2) and then you should think about goal(1). if you want to read books, you should say “i will be a reader”, if you want to play some instrument, you should think that you will be a musician. Don't forget: your beliefs affect your habits.

## How to build habits

The process of how actions are taken and habits are created consists of 4 simple steps: stimulus, desire, response and reward.

Stimulus is what triggers your brain to initiate a behavior. Your mind is constantly analyzing your internal and external environment for rewarding stimuli.

Desire is the motivating force behind every habit. Without Desire, there is no reason to act. You don’t want to, for example, smoke. You want the feeling of relief when you smoke. Each person reacts differently to stimuli. Thoughts, feelings and emotions are what transform stimulus into desire. 
	
The answer is action, is what you do when your stimulus and desire trigger. For it to happen, you need to be motivated (that is, you need stimulus and desire). And also, it depends on your ability to execute it. 
	
Lastly, and most important in forming a habit, is the reward. The first purpose of reward is to satisfy your desire. Second, rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future. The reward reinforces the stimulus.

In the next posts, I will explain the four laws of behavior change, what you can do for build good habits and break bad ones.
