# **2st law: Make it attractive**

We humans are prone to liking exaggerated versions of reality, for example, junk food. One of the main goals of food science is to make products more appealing to consumers. Not only that, look around: pornography with stimulating scenes at a rate is impossible to produce in real life; Social media offers more like and compliments than you get for your work; photo editing, advertising, fashion (not even the model looks like herself in the final image); Catchy titles, etc. These are all supernormal stimuli. They exaggerate characteristics that are naturally attractive and make our instincts go crazy.


Habits are feedback loops triggered by dopamine. Dopamine is not only related to pleasure, but also to neurological processes including motivation, learning and memory, punishment and aversion, and voluntary movements. dopamine is not only released when you experience an act, but also when you anticipate it.
Your brain has far more neutral circuitry dedicated to wanting rewards than liking them, and desire is what drives a behavior.


## **Temptation Bundling**


One way to make a habit appealing is to pair the action you want with one you need. 
For example, I want to use social media, but I need to exercise


After I use my phone, I will do my exercise.


After I do my exercise, I will use my phone.


## **Find your tribe**

The culture we live in determines which behaviors are appealing to us. We tend to adopt habits that are praides and approved because we have a strong desire to belong to the tribe. We imitate three social groups: the close (family and friends) the majority (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige).


The most effective way to build good habits is to join a culture where you desired behaviior is the default and you already have something in common with the group. the normal behavior of the tribe often trumps what the individual wants. If a behavior can earn ys approval, respect, and praise, we naturally find it appealing.


Practice associating your habits with something you enjoy, so you can use that stimulus whenever you need a little motivation. For example, associate your stretching with the act of focused training, conditioning your brain to think, “If this is happening, I should prepare for the next act”. If you usually focus on a task while listening to music on your headphones, the simple act of putting on your headphones can be your ritual.


# **2st law Inversed: make it uninteresting**

Understand the underlying reasons for your habits. A desire is just a specific manifestation of an underlying motive. You didn’t evolve with the desire to smoke, check social media, or play video games; you simply want to reduce uncertainty and relieve anxiety, gain status or social approval, or achieve status.

When you look at almost any habit-forming product, you will see that it doesn’t create motivation, but rather taps into an underlying motive in human nature.

## **Rewire your brain to enjoy hard things.**

Change your mindset. Want to wake up early? You don’t “have” to. You "can" wake up. Don't think about the challenge, think about the benefits. Change your perspective. If you want to train, don't just think that you need to, think about who you are, think about how you'll gain muscle, be healthier in the medium term, gain stamina, etc. If you want to save money, don't think about it as a sacrifice. Think about how living below your current means increases your future possibilities. What you save one month increases your purchasing power the next.

The key to finding and correcting the causes of your bad habits is to reframe your associations with them. It's not easy, but if you can reprogram your predictions, you can turn any difficult habit into an attractive one.
