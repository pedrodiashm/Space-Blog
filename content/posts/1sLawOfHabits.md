# Make it clear for good habits, make it invisible for bad habits

Before delving into the techniques, understand: your habits become automatic and end up being unconscious actions. In other words, you don't need to be aware of the stimulus for the habit to begin. This is what makes habits useful and dangerous.

Before building new habits, you must be aware of your current ones.
Point and talk: Method used by Japan to reduce errors. It literally consists of pointing at something and saying something to become aware. For example, you might see something out of place, point to it, and say "that's out of place." This technique can be used to identify what you do, what is wrong. Keeping your actions in mind and aware, it’s time to evaluate your habits. What is negative for you in the short or long term, what is positive and what is neutral.

**Implementation intention**: Consists of carrying out a behavior at a certain time and place. Establishing times and places where you will carry out an action is a way of making it clear what you want/should do when the time comes.

**Habit Stacking**: Simply associate the habit you want to do with a habit you already have. For example, “after drinking coffee, I will meditate”, “after taking off my work clothes, I will immediately dress in gym clothes”. This can be applied to future events. “when I go to parties, I introduce myself to a stranger”, etc.

**Design Your Environment**: The best way to create new habits is to change your environment. If you want to drink more water, fill several bottles and leave them around the house. If you want to play the guitar, leave it on a stand in the middle of your living room. If you want to watch less TV, remove the TV from the living room and only use it when you really feel necessary. If you want to use your cell phone less while studying/working, leave it in another room. Create separate spaces for each use: leisure, rest, study. Avoid changing contexts of one habit with others. In short, make encouraging good habits obvious in your environment. For bad habits, remove your stimuli from the environment (make it invisible).
